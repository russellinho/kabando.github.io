		<h3>(Undisclosed Name) FPS Demo</h3>
		<p>
			This is a demo for an ongoing FPS game that Nicholas Anthony and I are working on. Download, play, and message me via social media or email with any feedback!
			LAN Host is the only functioning option right now to play (single player), so click that! The controls are like your average FPS game: WASD to move, E to interact,
			click to shoot, right click to aim down sights.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Installation instructions:
			<ol>
				<li>Download the contents the link below.</li>
				<li>Ensure that they're all in the same directory and click on the .exe file to play.</li>
				<li>LAN Host is the only functioning matchmaking option right now, so only click that to play.</li>
			</ol>
