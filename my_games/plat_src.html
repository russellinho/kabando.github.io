		<h3>Client/Server Platformer</h3>
		<p>
			This is a simple multiplayer platformer game that uses the Processing networking API to connect multiple clients to a server using localhost as the IP address.
			This means that the server and client must be on the same machine.
			<br/>
			There is no objective here; it's just a simple platformer that was created with networking capabilities. I also implemented replay functionality. Directions on how to use replays is found below or in the README file.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			A = Begin recording a replay
			A = Stop recording a replay (pressed a second time after the first)
			W = Run the replay at normal speed (pressed before starting the replay)
			E = Run the replay at 2x speed (pressed before starting the replay)
			R = Run the replay at 0.5x speed (pressed before starting the replay)
			Q = Begin the replay (will only work after you've completely recorded a replay by pressing A twice)
			<br/>
