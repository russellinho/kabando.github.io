		<h3>Fireteam AI (Prototype 2)</h3>
		<p>
			Fireteam AI is an online multiplayer FPS action game that puts you on a team of 2-8 players to battle your way through a never-ending barrage of hostile forces in an enclosed map. Each map has its own mission which is divided into objectives such as defusing bombs, capturing a VIP, or stealing intel. You have limited resources, health, and only one life, so you must work efficiently as a team in order to complete the objectives successfully and as fast as possible. At least one person must be alive and escape in order to win. You may scavenge resources from corpses and re-spawn when an ally clears the sector. There is also a competitive mode where you race against other teams in different instances of the same mission.
