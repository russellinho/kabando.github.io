		<h3>Pong</h3>
		<p>
			This is my implementation of the classic game pong using the Processing networking API. The server acts as the first player and the client acts as the second player. The game runs on localhost, meaning that the server and client must play on different windows in the same machine.
			<br/>
			Hit the ball past the other player to score points (much like ping pong). Get to the desired amount to win!
			<br/>
			Installation instructions:
			<ol>
				<li>Download the zip folder at the "Download here" link below.</li>
				<li>Extract the contents from the zip folder to a directory on your PC.</li>
				<li>To start the game, double click on the MultithreadedServer.jar file.</li>
				<li>To connect the second player to server, double click on MultithreadedClient.jar only after MultithreadedServer.jar is already started.</li>
			</ol>
