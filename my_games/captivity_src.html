		<h3>Captivity</h3>
		<p>
			One night in Singapore, a group of four friends named G-Dragon, Sandman, 
			MK, and Meemo stumbled upon a mysterious bag of money. They took the money and split it four ways, 
			knowing that they could afford to take a vacation from college for a while with the money they made. 
			That same night, all four friends were kidnapped by an international criminal organization named the Agents of Entropy.
			<br/>
			Fight your way through leagues of gangsters while breaking through obstacles 
			as you make your way to the top of the hideout to escape.
